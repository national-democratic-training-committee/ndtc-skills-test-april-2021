# NDTC Skills Test 

Use the Art Institute of Chicago's public API to fetch artwork results.

- Use the linked component images located in `img/` as a guide for styling mobile and desktop
  - Component blocks should be centered on the page with a max block width of 600px
- Paginate results and limit to 10 results per page (pagination can be styled however you like)
- API information can be found here: 
  - Public API and documentation: `https://api.artic.edu/docs/`
  - Public data dump: `https://github.com/art-institute-of-chicago/api-data`
- Include files for HTML, CSS, PHP (if applicable), and JavaScript
- Plan how would you implement caching in the frontend? in the backend?
  - Implement backend API call caching strategy.
- Feel free to add vendor files in `js/vendor/` if needed.
- Consider how would you implement a server side proxy to the API using PHP. Feel free to use the built-in server or your framework of choice.
- Lastly, add appropriate commenting to your code to help explain your process.
