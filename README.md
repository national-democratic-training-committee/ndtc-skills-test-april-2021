# NDTC Skills Test 

Use the Art Institute of Chicago's public API to fetch artwork results.

- Use the linked component images located in `img/` as a guide for styling mobile and desktop
  - Component blocks should be centered on the page with a max block width of 600px
- Paginate results and limit to 10 results per page (pagination can be styled however you like)
- API information can be found here: 
  - Public API and documentation: `https://api.artic.edu/docs/`
  - Public data dump: `https://github.com/art-institute-of-chicago/api-data`
- Include files for HTML, CSS, PHP (if applicable), and JavaScript
- Use `localStorage` to cache image results.
- Feel free to add vendor files in `js/vendor/` if needed.

## Launch a PHP server from your terminal
```
cd path/to/your/app
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
```

## A Note On Fonts
